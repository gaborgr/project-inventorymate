## About the APP
<p>InventoryMate is a Django application designed for inventory management. It allows users to add, modify, and delete product records while providing key insights such as profit margins and the last update timestamp.</p>

## üìã Features
- Product Management: Add, edit, and delete products.
- Data Insights:
    + Profit margin calculation (sale price vs. last purchase cost).
    + Timestamp of the latest modification.
- User-Friendly Interface: A custom HTML interface designed for simplicity, without relying solely on Django's admin panel.
- Dynamic Database: Automatically updates and stores data with every operation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
The configuration process involves several key steps:
1. **Creating the Application:**
The app, named `product`, is included in the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in the main project settings.

2. **URL Routing:**
Three main routes were created:
    + A route to display the full inventory.
    + A route to show a product entry form.
    + A route for product search and modification.

3. **Database Model:**
A model was designed to structure product data in the database, including fields like name, quantity, sale price, supplier name, last purchase cost, profit margin, and last update timestamp.
Add a screenshot of the model schema here.

4. **View Functions:**
Each feature has a dedicated view to handle database interactions and render HTML templates. For example, here‚Äôs the view for displaying the complete inventory:

5. **Base Template for Reusability:**
A `base.html` template was created for consistent styling across the application, extended in all other templates.
